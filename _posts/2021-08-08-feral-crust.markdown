summary: 
- "An eco-anarchist collective based in Davao, Philippines, aiming to create a small, autonomous community land project. Set on a hilly terrain within the remaining forests that is home to native wildlife and both indigenous and non-indigenous people. \"We are working towards establishing an autonomous subsistence zone and living experiment based around principles of mutual aid, cooperation and ecology. We hope for it to become a place for direct communication, nurturing of relationships, establishing affinity and solidarity, working alongside land-based people (neighbors/community) and promoting mutual connection with all forms of life.\" Formerly an infoshop in urban Davao City."
